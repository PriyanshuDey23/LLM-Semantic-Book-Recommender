# Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs

## üìñ Overview
The Semantic Book Recommender leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector search to provide personalized book recommendations based on user queries. This system processes book descriptions, extracts emotional tones, and categorizes books to enhance discoverability. Using FAISS for vector storage, Google Generative AI for embeddings, and Gradio for a user-friendly interface, this project enables users to find books that match their interests and emotions seamlessly.

## üèó Key Components
This project consists of five major components:

1. **Text Data Cleaning** - Preprocessing and cleaning book descriptions.
   - Code: [`data-exploration.ipynb`](data-exploration.ipynb)
2. **Semantic Search & Vector Database** - Using FAISS to create a searchable book database.
   - Code: [`vector-search.ipynb`](vector-search.ipynb)
   - Functionality: Enables searching for books based on natural language queries (e.g., *"a book about a person seeking revenge"*).
3. **Text Classification (Zero-Shot Learning)** - Classifying books as *Fiction* or *Non-Fiction*.
   - Code: [`text-classification.ipynb`](text-classification.ipynb)
   - Functionality: Adds an extra filtering facet for users.
4. **Sentiment Analysis & Emotion Extraction** - Analyzing book emotions (joy, sadness, suspense, etc.).
   - Code: [`sentiment-analysis.ipynb`](sentiment-analysis.ipynb)
   - Functionality: Enables users to sort books based on emotional tones.
5. **Web Application (Gradio UI)** - An interactive dashboard for book recommendations.
   - Code: [`gradio-dashboard.py`](gradio-dashboard.py)
